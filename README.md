# Simple3PAttackSystem

Welcome to the **Simple3PAttackSystem** repository! This Unreal Engine project showcases a straightforward and engaging 3rd Person Attack System. The primary focus is on the Player and Enemy characters, both equipped with an Axe that can be easily swapped with other Edged and Bladed weapons like swords. 

Key features of this project include:

1. **Fluid Combat Mechanics**: The Player character is equipped with Foot IK, allowing for seamless animation blending and natural movement during combat. Players can perform single attacks or unleash powerful combo attacks by clicking at specific moments.

3. **Health Indicators**: Players can easily keep track of their own health, which is displayed on the top left corner of the screen. Additionally, the health of the Enemy is indicated with a red bar above their head, adding to the intensity of combat.

4. **Pause Functionality**: The game can be paused at any time using the 'P' key, giving players the freedom to take a breather, strategize, or attend to other matters.
5. **Camera Options**: The camera can be dynamically adjusted between shoulder and center positions, controlled by the 'C' key, to suit different player preferences.

6. **Dynamic Hit Calculation**: Each attack's direction is precisely calculated, resulting in impactful combat experiences. When attacked, the Enemy is pushed back according to the hit direction, adding a realistic touch to the encounters.

7. **Smart Enemy AI**: The Enemy uses a simple yet effective AI-BehaviorTree that utilizes the Environment Query System (EQS). This enables the Enemy to intelligently chase and engage the Player, attacking strategically within the appropriate range.
